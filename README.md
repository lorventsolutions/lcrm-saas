# Introduction

Lcrm Saas is the Software as a Service version of [Lcrm](https://codecanyon.net/item/lcrm-next-generation-crm-web-application/14506615?ref=jyostna).

The SaaS version contains Organization subscriptions powered by [Stripe](https://stripe.com) and [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/).

**Advantages of saas**:

Rather than purchasing software to install, or additional hardware to support it, customers subscribe to a SaaS offering. Generally, they pay for this service on a monthly basis using Stripe and Paypal. Transitioning costs to a recurring operating expense allows many businesses to exercise better and more predictable budgeting. Users can also terminate SaaS offerings at any time to stop those recurring costs.
