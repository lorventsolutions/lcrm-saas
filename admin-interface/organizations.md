# Organizations

The Organizations are the ones who use the service.

An organization can be created in two ways:

1\) By registering through the registration page\(signup\)

2\) Create the account through organizations page of admin section.

**Note:**

Creation of organizations from the admin section is intended to be used for payments you receive from other sources or if the user don't want to use subscriptions.

So you have to select a plan and mention the number of days the user will stay in the plan.

The Organizations consists of an admin user and his staff. The organizations can create companies and customers to interact.
