# Payments

In this page you can only see the Organizations which are created by ADMIN.

Payments are useful in situations where the user is unable to pay with card or if they don't want recurring payments.

Here you can change the plan or the duration of the organization's usage period for the organizations created manually by Admin.

* If admin changes the plan then the organization can continue to use the service without any interruption.
* If organization or user changes the plan using subscription page then you won't see them in this page any more and their account will be moved to SUBSCRIPTIONS \(stripe or paypal\).
* Here admin can see all the plans \(including NO VISIBILITY PLANS\)
