Subscriptions allow you to charge an Organization on a recurring basis.

So the organization will be charged at the end of the specified period for the plan they choose.

You can change the subscription plan for any organisation, or cancel the subscription entirely.

## **Subscriptions by Stripe:**

Once you cancelled the subscription, it is not terminated immediately. The subscription ends after the current period that the user have already paid for.
